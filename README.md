# Threads - Clone

> Inspired by Twitter, now X, and Threads, social media platforms became a must have communication tool to connect and reach out to a global audience. Using Next.js 13 and its powerful server/client rendering capabilities allows faster renders and seamlessly incorporates that technology into our components. Authentication is not a pain anymore with Clerk. Clerk handles social logins and username/password, along with webhooks that listen to real-time events and much much more.
